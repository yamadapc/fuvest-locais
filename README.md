=============
Web scrapping and data analysis of the University of SÃ£o Paulo's acceptance
test. It's a project with [@renzocom](https://github.com/renzocom) to try to
discover possible geographical (within the city's regions - supposedly related
to wealth) biases on the probability of a candidate to be accepted to USP.

Upon initial visual inspection with the `web` visualizations, there wasn't a
clear correlation found between the data, so the project was dropped.
